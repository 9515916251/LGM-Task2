# LGM-Task2
I would like to share #task2 which I have done at #letsgrowmore Virtual Internship Program.  Task Name : Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using Stacked LSTM algorithm. Source of the dataset: Kaggle Name of the dataset: NSE-TATA Global 
Task Name : Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using Stacked LSTM algorithm.
Source of the dataset: Kaggle
Name of the dataset: NSE-TATA Global
Tool used for coding: Google Colab
Level of the task : Basic level

About the task:
This task is about predicting the stock market prices. So, that I have collected the data from the Kaggle and gone through it. This dataset contains 1235 rows and 8 columns like High, Low, Total Trade Quantity, Turnover(Lacs), etc...
I have used various plot diagrams to visualize the data in a proper mannner for prediction. I have used scatterplot, count plot, histogram, line and bar charts for data visualization. Then I have build a machine learning model for stock market prediction.

I would like to thank #Mr. Aman Kesarwani sir and #LetsGrowMore for giving this opportunity to do this tasks.
